#HELPS
0 VALHERU~
Long ago, the world was rules by the Valheru.  They were an ancient
race, able to fly across the skies on the backs of mighty dragons.  Their
lives were ruled by the gods of chaos and destruction.  They cared not 
for the lives of their mortal servants, using them as play things and
killing them in their insane rage.  No one could stand up to the Valheru,
their combined might was unrivaled.  They destroyed any who were
foolish enough to stand in their path, until the day when they saw there
was no one left to destroy.  They turned their gaze upwards, to the
heavens.  So great was their power, they sought to challenge the gods.
It would bring about their death.  While their power was immense it
wasn't enough for this battle.  The Valheru were destroyed, all save
one.  Only one had been wise enough to know their own limits.  He
was the oldest Valheru, Ashen Shugar.  He ruled the land for many
generations, until one day he too passed from this earth.

That was many generations ago, and once again the Valheru are united.
They are all the descendants of Ashen Shugar, and his blood flow within
their veins.  While they are only mere mortals now, they conquer and rule
through strength of arms.  Their goal is to once again have the world
kneel and beg before the Valheru.

The Valheru has three important ranks.  They are lead by Boldar who is 
a direct descendant of Ashen Shugar.  Kyriel and Ingen serve as his left
and right hand, the Dragon Lords of the clan.  Everyone else works their
way up to the rank of Dragon Rider where they can serve as warriors for
the Valheru.

There are no requirements to join Valheru.  Players are recruited, not
their statistics.  Generally in order to join the Valheru the three leaders
must all agree that the applicant would make the clan stronger.  If even
one disagrees, you won't be joined to the clan.  If you wish to join the
try to impress us with your skills in combat.  Thats the only way to join
the Valheru.

`WThe City of Forever`n~
`dAn odd spot appears in the grey, the first hint of any reality
in rift-space. It is a city, a place of terrible and alien beauty.
It possessed towers of twisted symmetry, minarets impossibly slender,
oddly designed buildings that sprawled below the vaulting arches
between the towers.`n

`dBeyond the boundaries of the City of Forever, the grey of
rift-space could be seen.  The Garden was surrounded by a moat,
but instead of water, there is nothing.  Only the void of rift-
space.  A large circle of land floats beside the city. Atop
this circle of earth a garden of lush vegetation sat, fully
covering every inch of the surface.  It brimmed with meandering
streams, which spilled over the edge.   Frut trees of every 
description could be see.  This is indeed a most improbable place.`n

`WThe Star Pillars`n~
`dSeven pillars rise from the city.  At first they appear black,
but upon closer inspection there are tiny flecks of light within.  
The pillars are composed of tiny stars, comets, and planets,
miniature galaxies galleries swirling within the confines of
the pillars, locked within a void as black true space.  It
may be that the true universe is contained within these
pillars.`n

`WA Strange Building`n~
A tall building rises up before you.  It has no windows and there
is only one door.  It is made out of the a strange black stone, 
that pulses with a strange energy.  Where this rock was found is
anyone guess, but you probably wouldn't like the answer.  The
door is gigantic.  Twice the size of a man, and 10 feet across.
Behind it lies the mystical Hall of Worlds.

`WThe Hall of Worlds`n~
long hallway stretches out into space.  There are no
walls, merely the grey void of rift-space.  Standing tall
along the edge of the hall are the doors.  Thousands of
them, marching on towards infinity.  Each leading to a
different place, another world, a different dimension.
The hallway never ends, it simple continues on and on.
It is up to you to choose your door, and choose your
fate.

`WA Wall of Flame`n~
A strange red light glows in the distance, as you move
closer you see it is a mysterious wall of flame, running
about one mile in length.  Waves of scorching heat cause
your skin to blister, forcing you to draw back.  This 
wall serves no apparent , it has no reason for being, 
the is no use for it.  It simply exists.  Another mystery
of the City of Forever.
