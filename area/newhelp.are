#HELPS




0 PATRYN PATRYNS~
Patryn warriors do battle with and through their command of elemental
runes.  While once the runes a Patryn could draw on were as endless as
the concepts their minds could encompass, this is no longer the case.
However, runemagic of the present is still a potent force, which when
wielded with skill and cunning is a match for any form of magical or
spiritual attack.

 (*) Learn: learn how to use a given rune.
 (*) Tattoo: tattoo elemental runes onto the body.
 (*) Erase: a difficult to erase a rune from the body.
 (*) Runetrain: train in the use of primary runes.
 (*) Runestat: examine the runes on your body.
 (+) Runeweave: weave runes in the air to create magickal effects.
 (*) Circle: enhanced regen based on runetraining. 
 (*) Defenses: Raise or lower certain runic defenses.
 ( ) Inscribe: etch runes of power on weapons.
~

0 RUNETRAIN RUNETRAINING~
Syntax: runetrain <primary rune>
Example: runetrain earth

Runetraining is how patryns become adept in the use of the primary,
elemental runes.  These are Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Energy, and
Negative.  Runetraining is necessary to be able to runeweave
effectively, increases the power of tattoos,  and greatly enhances
a patryn's ability to close their circle.
~

0 DEFENSES~
Syntax: defenses <raise/lower>
Example: defenses lower
Example: defenses

The defenses command toggles whether a patryn's runic danger
sense is set off by attmpts to locate them.  Without an
argument, the command will report whether your defenses
are raised or lowered.
~

0 LEARN~
Syntax: learn <rune>
Example: learn destruction
Example: learn cost

Learning a rune is necessary for any use of a rune.  The cost of
learning a rune is in primal, and increases as you learn more
runes.  Typing 'learn cost' will display how much primal the next
rune will cost.  It is suggested that you learn the primary elements
first, as they are the most useful of the runes.
~

0 TATTOO TATTOING TATTOOING~
Syntax: tattoo <body part> <rune>
Example: tattoo rightleg water

By tattooing runes onto their bodies, Patryns enhance their combat
prowess.  Acceptable body parts are 'torso', 'leftarm', 'rightarm',
'leftleg' and 'rightleg'.  Only the primary runes of fire, air, earth
and water may be tattooed.  Here is an imcomplete list of the effects:

Torso:  Air   - Magickal Protection
        Earth - Toughness
        Fire  - Protection from Ki attacks
        Water - Enhanced regen
Arms:   Air   - Attacks
        Earth - Enhanced parry
        Fire  - Damage multiplier
Legs:   Earth - Anti parry/dodge
        Water - Enhanced dodge

Each rune costs primal, with costs increasing as the number of runes
per body part increase.
~

0 ERASE~
Syntax: erase <body part> <rune>
Example: erase leftarm air

Erasing magickal runes is a costly and time-consuming process,
requiring 25 primal and 1000 mana per erasure.  When a rune is
erased, the space on the body part becomes available again.
~

0 RUNESTATS~
Syntax: runetats

This provides a list of what runes are currently tattooed on your body.
It lists them by body part, and shows both used and available slots.
~

0 RUNEWEAVE RUNEWEAVING~
Syntax: runeweave <target> <primary rune> <secondary rune>
Example: runeweave fido fire death


~

0 LEGEND~
Legend is an abstract measurement of character 'presense', costing
both experience and status to train.  Legend ranks grant certain
minor abilities to all players, none of which are necessary to
be effective in pk, but which can be highly useful.

See LCOMMANDS for a list of said abilities.
~

0 LCOMMANDS~
Tricks of the trade which anybody can learn over time, only the more
experienced adventurer will learn abilities such as these.  Keep in
mind that they are merely useful abilities, not powerful combat
techniques.  Take them for what they are.

Legend  1:  Numeric damage           Legend  6:  Dare
Legend  2:  Gift                     Legend  7:  Reclaim
Legend  3:  Preserve                 Legend  8:  Humiliate
Legend  4:  Lenter & Lexit           Legend  9:  Soul Reaver 
Legend  5:                           Legend 10:  Challenge
~

0 GIFT~
When gift is implemented, it will allow you to transfer the ownership
of an item from yourself to another person.
~

0 LENTER LEXIT~
Syntax: lenter <phrase>
Syntax: lexit <phrase>

With these, you can modify the messages displayed upon your entering
and leaving chaosium.

Lenters and Lexits may not duplicate or emulate other system messages,
such as escape messages, or be intentionally deceptive.
~

0 RECLAIM~
This legend ability allows you to shift ownership of an item in your
possession from its previous owner to yourself.  This does, of course,
come at a cost.
~

0 HUMILIATE HUMILIATION~
Syntax: humilate <mortalled wounded schmuck>
Syntax: humiliation <amusing phrase>

Humiliate allows you to finish off players and display a finishing
message of your own creation.  The message is broadcast to the entire
mud in place of the normal finishing messages.  The humiliation command
is for setting this message.

Humiliations are broadcast to the mud, and as such are subject to certain
standards.  In practice, the only thing I don't want to see is messages
of a sexual nature.  Sex is one of the (very) few things here which is
consensual in nature.
~

0 SOULREAVER REAVER 'SOUL REAVER'~

When you finish off (not humiliate) an avatar, you drain their life
force and regain a percentage of your hit points.  How much depends
on how robust the victim was.
~

0 RULES COMMANDMENTS~
The Ten Commandments:
1) Kill and decapitate other immortals, or else:
2) Other immortals will kill and decapitate you.
3) Forgiveness may be devine, but vengeance is much more fun.
4) Don't whine or complain, or someone will kill you.
5) If someone whines or complains, you should kill them.
6) If someone doesn't whine or complain, kill them anyway.
7) Might makes right; a corpse will never betray you.
8) Friends are useful.  So is the exp you get for decapitating them.
9) Turn in bugs for rewards.  Abuse bugs and lose more than you gained.
10) Stop reading the stupid rules and let the slaughter commence!
~

0 POLICY POLICIES~
The purpose of all policies is to create an environment in which people
can compete, socialize, and generally have fun.  Punishments for infractions
are meant both as a deterrent, and as a guarantee that cheaters will not
prosper.  There are help files for each infraction listed below.  It is
strongly suggested that you read and obey them.

   MULTIPLAYING is banned, period.
   BOTTING is frowned upon and actionable.
   PUBLIC CHANNELS are for talking, not spamming.
   BUG ABUSE is highly illegal and will be punished severely.
   UNIQUES are not to be destroyed.
   CHAR SHARING is frowned upon.
   CHAR THEFT will result in the stolen char and the thief being banned.
   GIFT CAPPING is illegal.
   DUMBASS means do not be a dumbass.
   HARASSMENT this is a pk mud, it takes a LOT to be harassment.

   See the capitalized help files for more in depth explanations.

~


0 MULTIPLAYING~

Passing equipment or money between characters is just fine.  Anything
else, and I mean ANYTHING, is not fine.  This includes idling with more
than one character, grouping characters for exping or pkill, or ANYTHING
other than 30 seconds of swapping belongings.  I repeat, anything that
involves having two characters logged on at once, and not for a short
30 second equipment swap, is multiplaying.  Penalties will vary by
offense.
~

0 BOTTING~

This is defined as any actions which your character makes when the
player is not at the monitor.  There is really no need for botting,
as there are no spell levels or such to be botted up.  While botting
is not prohibited per se, 'bad things' may happen to botters, such as
my alerting the mud to what they're doing, dropping them in a no-exit
room, or in particularly irritating cases allowing players to get a
few caps on them.
~

0 PUBLIC 'PUBLIC CHANNELS'~

These exist so that people can socialize.  As such, people interfering
with their normal use (e.g. spamming) will lose their use.  Content
will for the most part be unpoliced; I am not easily offended.
~

0 BUGS ABUSE 'BUG ABUSE'~

If you find a a bug, or something you think is a bug, don't use it.
Don't "test" it, or play with it.. just report it on the bugs board.
If I deem you to have abused a bug, you will lose what you gained and
more.  Equipment related bugs (e.g. duping) will likely result in a
loss of equipment, character related bug abuse will likely result in
loss of character stats and abilities.  I will not hesitate to deny
and/or siteban repeat offenders; as somebody who has abused the hell
out of bugs on a number of muds, and seen how people pick up the habit
when the imms don't do shit, I know this to be absolutely necessary.
~

0 UNIQUES~

Destruction of a unique by any means (junking a container, saccing a
corpse, suiciding a char, etc etc) will result in the denial of all
a player's characters.  Uniques must be kept on the most played
character a player posesses, and if that character is not played and
pked with regularly the unique will be stripped.
~

0 CHARSHARING 'CHAR SHARING'~

Any sharing of characters or passwords is strongly discouraged.  If
you lose a character, you're shit out of luck.  Do yourself a favor;
always use different passwords on each character, and never use a
password here that you have used elsewhere.
~

0 CHARTHEFT 'CHAR THEFT'~

If I determine a character to be stolen, both the thief's characters
and the stolen character will be denied.  The reason for the latter
is simple: every instance of character theft costs me time to check
up on, and character theft is 99.99% of the time directly the result
of stupidity on the part of the former owner.  I am not a babysitter.
~

0 GIFTCAPPING 'GIFT CAPPING'~

This is defined as allowing other players to finish or humiliate your
character without fighting back.  Doing this once to settle a dispute
or matter of honor is not illegal; doing so multiple times, especially
to any and all takers, is.
~

0 DUMBASS COLUMBO PALON~

It shouldn't be necessary to spell this out, but don't be a fucking
dumbass.  Be a prick, a dick, a backstabber or whatever.. but don't
be a fucking dumbass.  I don't piss off easily.. if you manage to piss
me off, chances are it's because you were/are being a dumbass.
~

0 HARASSMENT~

This is a pk mud, with a pk atmosphere.  Somebody killing you a few
times, or keeping you morted for a few minutes, is not harassment.
I define harassment as a continual and systematic attempt to make
somebodys life miserable.  This isn't necessarily illegal except
in very extreme situations.  Use a little judgement.
~

0 GODWARS~
This is not a godwars mud per se; no actual godwars code from any release
has been used.  However, many of the concepts presented are borrowed from
the godwars system.  I'd like to thank KaVir for originally creating
godwars, and Coal and Puck for creating a truely good godwars mud.~

0 GWCOMMANDS~
There are a number of commands which are not indigenous to the Merc codebase
but are vital to playing on a godwars style mud.  Here are a few of them:

  FINISH, ESCAPE, SKILLS, LEVEL, BANDAGE
~

0 FINISH DECAPITATE~
Syntax: finish <mortally wounded avatar>
Example: finish sahra

When a player is mortally wounded, another avatar can finish them
off.  Known in the past as 'decpitation', finishing is possible with
any weapon, not just slashing and slicing.  If the victim is much
weaker, the finisher may become PARADOXED.~

0 ESCAPE~
Syntax: escape

When mortally wounded, an avatar can throw all pride to the wind and
attempt to escape.  They can't do this when tied up.  Escaping will
cause an avatar to lose whatever mana and stamina they had, and will
lag them for a short while.~

0 SKILLS~
Syntax: skills

This command gives you an analysis of your fighting skills in weapon
and stance.  If you are fighting somebody, it displays theirs as well.~

0 LEVEL LEVELS~
Syntax: level

This displays important information about your character's battle skills.
Stance and weaponskill ratings are shown, and for some classes additional
class specific information is displayed.
~

0 BANDAGE BANDAGES BANDAGING~
Syntax: bandage <target>
Example: bandage self

As not all classes have the mystick ability to heal, some form of first
aid was necessary to allow all classes to help their friends when wounded.
This is it.
~

0 STATS~
A characters statistics, or 'stats' as they are known, are measurements
of their strengths.  They range from 10 to 100, though not every class
can attain a rating of 100 in every stat.  See the help files on BODY,
MIND, SPIRIT, and WILLPOWER for more information.

Class        Body   Mind   Spirit   Willpower
Fist         90     75     100      80
Patryn       80     100    75       85
Saiyan       100    75     90       80
Sorcerer     75     90     80       100
Mazoku       95     95     95       95
~

0 BODY~
A characters body rating is a measurement of their overal physical
abilities, including strength, stamina, agility and general physical
wellbeing.  It affects damage done, damage recieved, how much one can
carry or wield, as well as how quickly your wounds heal.~

0 MIND~
Mind is an abstract measurement of a characters mental facility.  This
includes intelligence, cunning, and abstracts like problem solving
ability.  It affects resistance to mental attacks, how easy it is to
learn something, and especially ones abilities in rune magic.~

0 SPIRIT~
Spirit is an abstract measurement of, well, spirit.  How in touch with
themselves and the world around them, how wise they are, and well the
strength of their 'soul' or 'spirit', however you choose to call it.
Spirit is the driving force behind all Ki attacks and ki-based attacks,
and can help in resisting them.~

0 WILLPOWER~
Not so much a physical attribute, this is a measurement of a characters
strength of "will".  It can be described as drive, or as how much a
character can push themselves beyond their physical limits.  Magic, such
as it is, depends on a characters willpower.~

0 SAIYAN SAIYAJIN SAIYANS~
The Saiyan race is one much like the human race, save that they evolved
from monkeys as opposed to apes.  Though they are rumored to have once
had tails, this is no longer the case.  What sets the Saiyans, or
Saiya-jin as they are sometimes called, apart from other races is their
natural strength and propensity for battle.  They can charge and focus
their Ki more easily than any other race.

 (*) Technique: learn a saiyan battle technique.
 (*) Rage: Charge up power.
 (*) Focus: Spend power to enhance attributes.

 See HELP SAITECH for more information on Saiyan battle techniques.
 Also, see HELP STRENGTH, HELP SPEED, and HELP AEGIS.
~

0 RAGE~
Syntax: rage

Raging is the process by which Saiyans charge up their fighting power.
Rage costs movement points, and works based upon your body and spirit
ratings.  That is, the higher the body and spirit, the more power you
can charge up per rage.
~

0 TECHNIQUE~
Syntax: technique <argument>
Example: technique kamehameha
Example: technique cost
Example: technique learned

Technique is the command used to learn Saiyan battle techniques.  Most
of these are ways of inflicting damage with fighting power, while some
are useful noncombat abilities.  Typing 'technique' alone will list the
techniques, as well as two arguments, 'cost' and 'learned' which can be
entered to find out more information about techniques.

See 'help saitech' for a list of techniques and basic descriptions.
~

0 SAITECHS~
Name        Cost   Description
Kiblast     500    A basic low-level energy attack.
Kibomb      2000   A mid-level energy attack that hits multiple targets.
Kibolt      2000   A focused mid-level energy attack.
Kiwave      2000   A difuse mid-level energy attack which staggers targets.
Kiwall      2500   A very short-term energy defense which reduces damage.
Kikouhou    5000   A ranged attack of moderate power.
Masenkouha  5000   A powerful high-level energy attack.
Kamehameha  15000  The turtle destruction blast.
Solarfist   2500   A stunning attack which can blind the target.
Ryuken      10000  An awesome physical attack, but quite draining.
Zanzouken   n/a    A technique which allows a saiyan to attack more often.
Kaiouken    20000  A short-term but very powerful boost to attacks.
Flight      250    The ability to fly.
Kisense     n/a    The ability to sense the location of another being.
Bat. sense  500    An accurate measurement of an opponents strengths.
Shunkanidou 10000  A technique for teleporting onesself.
Hawkeyes    500    A technique for enhancing ones vision.
Kiaihou     n/a    A defensive technique to defend against multiple enemies

~

0 FOCUS~
Syntax: focus <power rating> <ammount>
Example: focus speed 150

Focus lets you spend power to increase your speed, strength or aegis.
If you spend more than your rating, the energy is wasted.
~

0 STRENGTH~
This saiyan power rating enhances the damage dealt in combat.
~

0 SPEED~
This saiyan power rating allows saiyans to get more attacks, parry and
dodge more, and hit more often.
~

0 AEGIS~
This saiyan power allows saiyans to absorb damage done to them.
As well, so long as it remains above 0, Saiyans can inflict strong
damage unarmed, and when it is above 250 they can parry unarmed.
~

0 FIST FISTS~
Fists are mystical warriors who shun the use of weapons.  While they can
wield them they will always be much more deadly using just their hands.
They have learned to focus their ki into amazing combinations, which have
the ability to lay waste to their opponents. Unfortunately a single
mistimed blow can cause these combinations to shatter, and many unexpected
results can occur.  When a true fist has learned to master every one of
their combinations, and practiced them to the point of perfection, there
is little that can stand in their way.

See Also:
Help basic, help combination, help fistki, help bodytrain, help discipline,
help newbiefist, help master
~

0 BASIC~ 
A fist must first learn to train in their basic moves by using the ‘master’
command.  There are low damage moves, but they are necessary in order to
execute the fist combinations.
~

0 MASTER~
Syntax: master <[move]/swap> [move1] [move2]
Example: master shinkick
Example: master ki
Example: master swap uppercut knee

Master is the command used by fists to learn master moves, increase
their max Ki, and swap the ki gain values of master moves. Learning a
master move costs 500,000 exp, as does training a point of Ki.

Swapping moves costs 150 primal.  To see what affect a swap will have,
look at 'master list' or master with no argument, to see your current
ki gain values for each move.  If shinkick is at 7, and jab is at 6, and
you master swap shinkick jab, shinkick will then have an average ki gain
of 6, and jab an average ki gain of 7.
~

0 COMBINATION COMBO~ 
Syntax: combo <phrase>
Example: combo
Example: combo dark

Combinations are the true power of fists.  They are executed by building up
the Fist’s ‘ki’ And then using the ‘Combo’ command.  Every ki from 10-30 has
a certain move attached to it.  Not all of them are beneficial so it is wise
to find a friend and spar them until you have tried out every combination.

Some combos, such as #29, have multiple moves associated with them.  They
can be accessed with an argument to the combo command.  For combo 29, the
acceptable arguments are 'dark' and 'holy'.
~

0 FISTKI~
A fist must activate their ki by using basic moves, but they must first train
there body to hold the power of that ki.  This is done by using the master
command.  Note:  The ki in prompt fist is NOT your max ki.  That is your active
ki, the one that is checked for combinations.
~

0 BODYTRAIN BODYTRAINING~
A Fist trains different parts of their body in order to become better fighters.
They can train their torso, their arms, their legs, and their hands. The command
to do this is ‘bodytrain.’  All bodyparts can be train up to 100.

Torso:  This affects toughness and regeneration
Arms:  This affects a fist’s blocking skill
Hands: This affects damage
Legs: This affects damage and dodge
~

0 DISCIPLINES~
Discipline is a rating of a Fist's.. well.. discipline.  You increase it by
typing 'discipline', and spending 500k per the level you wish to attain.
The ranks are:

1  eyesight     See in the dark, and see that which is unseen.
2  weaponskill  Unarmed skill can go up to 500. (auto)
3  stanceskill  Stances can go up to 300. (auto)
4  levitate     Levitate yourself.
5  roundhouse   A powerful attack that hits all enemies.
6  tackle       Prevent cowards from fleeing easily. (auto) 
7  innerfire    Attempt to burn away negative effects with Ki.
8  phoenixaura  Charge up spiritual energies to enhance combat abilities.
9  dim-mak      An attack which can poison the spirit of the victim.
~

0 NEWBIEFIST~ 
This is a small helpfile that should help a new fist get started.  There are
several things a new fist must do in order to be successful. 

1.  Prompt fist, this will put your ki in your prompt.  Without this
    combinations are nearly impossible.
2.  Each basic move has a set ki that will be added.  However to prevent the
    use of scripting and aliases this number will be modified by plus or minus
    one.  When trying to learn a move’s ki value, try it repeatedly until you
    see 3 different results.  The middle will be the true ki value.
    Example:  The true ki value of uppercut is two.  However there is a small
    chance of it being modified into either a one or three.
3.  Once you have learned the true ki values for all your basic moves, it is
    smart to alias them to the numbers on your keyboard.  This can make
    combinations much easier to perform.
4.  Every time you use the ‘combo’ command, your current ki is checked.  The
    combination assigned to that ki is performed.  It is wise to get a pen and
    pencil, and try every combination from ki 10 to ki 30.
5.  A Fist is one of the best tanks in the game.  Use this to your advantage.
6.  Max your unarmed and stance, this is the biggest factor in the damage you do.
~

0 COLOR~
Colors are pretty simple, to add a color code use a `` (the thing on the tilde
key).  Follow it with a upper or lowercase letter, using the chart below as a
guide.

  `bb blue`n          `BB bright blue`n
  `mm magenta`n       `MM bright magenta`n

work on something sooner than planned if it turns out to be
particularly easy or important.

 + Mazoku improvements
 + Patryn improvements
 + Random gen armor
 + Soldier class
 + Stability issues

~

0 GWNEWBIE~ 
This is a help file for those of you who have never played godwars
before.  While this mud is not a Godwars code, it is modified to play
and act like it.  It is a heavy pk mud, and we do encourage you to rip
off as many heads as possible. The first major difference is there are
no levels here.  You gain strength by killing mobs for experience which
is then used to 'train' your statistics.  Experience is also used to buy
your class powers.  You can do this anywhere, you don't even have to be
near a guildmaster.  Also, we have edited  the Damroll and Hitroll formulas.
You are not penalized for having bad eq, instead it is an added bonus.
This means until you start to fight the HIGHEST mobs, and players, eq
isn't needed.  We feel this will help you get into the game faster, and
start having more fun. Overall this is a very fun code to play, and I hope
you enjoy it.

See also, Help: avatar, claim, train, level, practice, stance, status,
paradox, classes, godwars, gwcommands, legend
~

0 AVATAR~
An avatar is basically a pkiller.  You can become an avatar by training it.
This means mobs will no longer kill you, they will only send you to -10 hp.
If the mob is aggresive they will continue to do this until you use the
escape command.  Overall this mud should be newbie friendly, so there
shouldn't be anything stopping you from becoming an avatar.  The benefit of
having access to your class powers is huge, it will allowed you to gain
experience much faster.  Train avatar when you can, sure there may be an
asshole who kills you, but there are 5 other people willing to help you.
~

0 CLAIM~ 
When you claim ownership an item it costs 250 primal points.  What this
does is it makes you the owner of that item.  When you die the item will
travel with you, making it unlootable.  However if you drop the item or
lose it in some other way, it can be taken by anyone.  You will still be
the owner, but you will have to devise some plan to get it back into your
possession.  Ownership here is NOT like claim on other Godwars.  There is
no call command.  It is advised you claim ownership if only items you
wouldn't want to lose, and put the rest in a container you own.
~

0 TRAIN~
Training is how you increase your statistics.  You can train your
hp/mana/move here for experience.  The cost is equal to your current max
in that statistic.  If you have 5002 hp, it will cost 5002 experience for
that next point.  You can also train your body/mind/spirit/will power (see
help stat).  Primal is a way to channel your experience points, every point
has an increasing cost.  Primal is used to gain some classpowers.  Training
avatar will make you pkable, but it is also used to activate your class
powers.  That is basically all there is to training, and remember, train
anywhere, and everywhere!
~

0 LEVEL~
When you type level you will see three things: weapons, stances, and your
ratings in some class powers.  The weapons and stances can only be improved
by using them, and the classpowers are increased in various ways (depending
on your class).  The first section is the weapons.  It is advised you max
all weapons at 200.  Your chance to parry depends on your skill in your
opponents weapon.  If Bob is using claw, and I have 0 in it, I will not
parry many blows.  The same holds true for stances, you should max them all.
~

0 PRACTICE~
Practice will give you a short list of skills you can improve in.  This
costs experience.  The list of skills is short, because many of the other
things were useless, or we have added a different command to replace them.
Just practice everything to 100.
~

0 STANCE~
The first thing you should know about stances is the autostance command.
By typing 'autostance lion' you will automatically assume the lion stance
when combat begins (in most cases).  There are 2 rows of stances, the top
level being basic and the bottom being advanced.  Every advanced stance has
a prerequisite of 2 basic stances that must be master before it can be used.
The offensive stances are on the left and the defense are on the right.
You can also gain a small advatage in combat by outstancing your opponent.
In general a stance will beat the one one its left, for example eagle beats
hawk.  The one exception to this is hawk will defeat stork, making the circle
complete.  Everyone's stances are maxed at 200, the exception being the fist
class who gets them to 300.
~

0 AUTOSTANCE~
Syntax: autostance <some stance>

Autostance selects a stance which you will automatically assume when you
start fighting.  If you attack or whirlwind attack somebody, or they attack
you in these ways, your autostance will kick in.

For a list of stances, see level.
~


0 PARADOX~
2nd classes may safely finish 2nd classes.
1st classes may safely finish 1st classes.
Powerfuls my safely finish Powerfuls and above.

If a 1st class or higher finishes a character of a lower assessment, they
will be paradoxed for their cowardice: teleported to midgaard, mortally
wounded, and frozen for around thirdy seconds.

If a 2nd or 1st class kills above it's level, they will be deemed 'fair game',
and made cappable by anybody.  So.. don't escape cap far stronger players.
~

0 WHIRL~
Syntax: whirl

This skill allows you to execute a whirlwind attack, which hits everybody
in the room.  While not very accurate, it is a good way to get a fight going,
and as you spin around madly whacking everythign you may even hit things or
people you can't see.
~

0 SORCERER SORCERERS~
Sorcerers are human practitioners of the mystic arts.  They call on powerful
forces of good and evil, as well as natural spirits, to create supernatural
effects through force of will.  While often skilled with weapons by mortal
standards, they are spellcasters first and warriors second, and prefer to
attack with their magic.  While vulnerable in the physical sphere, they are
the most powerful in the mystic sphere since the corruption of Rune Magic.

 (*) Chant: Utter the words to activate a sorcerous spell.
 (*) Research: Learn more about a school of magic.
 (*) Specialize: Focus ones training on a particular branch of magic.
 (*) Concentrate: Toggle the conversion of mana to mystic energy.
 (*) Prepare: Select a school of magic to use for melee-round attacks.

See help files on: CHANT, RESEARCH, SPECIALIZE, MYSTIC, BLACKMAGIC,
WHITEMAGIC, WINDMAGIC, EARTHMAGIC, FIREMAGIC, WATERMAGIC, ASTRALMAGIC.

~

0 MYSTIC 'MYSTIC ENERGY'~
Mystic energy is the basis for sorcery, the raw power than is focused into
physical effects.  There is a finite limit on how much any human sorcerer
can hold at any time, however, and if they exhaust their store without
taking the time to replenish it, they will find it spread too thin in their
spells for them to have much effects.

A sorcerer's store of mystic energy restores itself slowly on it's own.
Sorcerers can increase the rate of restoration by concentrating their mana
into mystic energy.  See HELP CONCENTRATE.
~

0 CONCENTRATE~
Syntax: concentrate
Example: concentrate

The concentrate command toggles the conversion of mana into mystic energy.
When a sorcerer is concentrating, their mana will drop rapidly when it is
being used to refill their store of mystic energy.  With concentrate toggled
off, sorcerers can regenerate their mana.
~

0 CHANT~
Syntax: chant '<spell>' [target]
Example: chant 'balus rod' orc
Example: chant 'rubyeye blade'

Sorcerery is driven by words of power and invocations to dark, light, and
neutral spirits.  In come cases, only a couple words must be spoken, however
in the case of more powerful spells, several lines must be spoken.  The
spell need only be chanted once, and you will continue the chant until it
is complete or interrupted.
~

0 RESEARCH~
Syntax: research <school of magic>
Example: research black

Sorcerers learn more about the various schools of magic by researching them.
This costs primal, in increasing ammounts as the rank attained increases.
Sorcerers specialized in a given school can achieve a greater mastery of
that school than other sorcerers.  Specialists can achieve 50 ranks, while
the unspecialized can achieve 40.  Specialists also pay a slightly lower
cost for researching their chosen speciality.
~

0 SPECIALIZE~
Syntax: specialize <branch of magic>
Example: specialize white magic

Nearly all sorcerers focus their studies on one particular type of magic.
While this doesn't exclude them from learning other types, they become most
proficient in this one type.  The three branches of magic are Black magic,
White magic, and Shamanism.  It should be noted that while black and white
are schools of magic themselves, there are five schools of shamanistic magic.
Also, specializing for the first time is free, but a sorcerer wishing to
change specialty must overcome their past training, and pay a horrendous
cost for it.
~

0 CONCENTRATE~
Syntax: concentrate
Example: concentrate

Toggles whether a sorcerer concentrates their mana into mystical energy
quickly.  Without concentrating, no mana is spent, and mystical is regained
at approximately one point per second.  When concentrating, mana is spent
and mystical regained five times or more faster.
~

0 PREPARE~
Syntax: prepare <magic school/none>
Example: prepare astral

By preparing to use a school, sorcerers can substitute magical damage for
their melee round.  Only some spells are fast enough casting to be used
as such; the most powerful fast-casting spell you know in the chosen school
will be used.  Prepare none to switch back to normal melee.

0 REIMBURSEMENT~
If you played during beta, you are entitled to recieve some form of
reimbursement based on how strong your character was.  This is meant
to reflect the ammount of feedback I recieved as a whole from your
playing of a beta character.  To recieve the reimb, in the form of
spendable reimb tokens, send a personal note to me (Alathon), from
the character which you want to Recieve the reimb, with reimb as the
subject, and with your beta characters name and password as the body
of the note.  Once I verify these, your new character will be credited.

~

0 CLANCOST~
These are the costs in gold coins to purchase various clan-specific
entities, such as rooms, guards, furniture etc.  To buy something, the
clan leader must post a note to me, Alathon, on the personal board,
saying exactly what they wish to purchase.  After I recieve that, I
will meet with the clan leader and be paid, after which the items in
question will be installed.

 Cost        Item
 50,000      Furniture
 50,000      Rename a mob, room, desc, or furniture
 50,000      Item on shopkeeper (must be approved)
 100,000     Have a member banished offline.
 250,000     A quest master
 250,000     Shopkeeper (six items max)
 500,000     A room (include description)
 500,000     Clan guard (six per clan)
 500,000     Clan Banker
 750,000     A reset of a Gundam mobile suit (four max)

 1,000,000   Clan tailor (restring eq to clan descriptions)
 5,000,000   Rename a clan (name, sigil, ranks, does not include rooms/guards).

A basic clan HQ requires two rooms, one clanguard, and one banker,
for a total cost of 2,000,000 gold.
~

0 PRESERVE~
Syntax: preserve <item>
Example: preserve corpse
Example: preserve heart

Some items such as food, corpses, and body parts may be preserved such
that they won't decay as they normally would.  Preserving costs nothing
more than a few moments, and is great for producing mementos of battles
and invasions.
~

0 DARE~
Syntax: dare <player character>
Example: dare ardneh

Dare is a command which issues a challenge to another player to Not log
off like a wuss.  As it is assumed that your characters, being part of
a PK mud, are not complete and utter pansies, they will respond to this.
For the cost of 100 primal you can issue a dare that will, in essense,
give the target avatar a fight timer.
~

0 MULTIPLAYING MP~
One human player or equivalent non-human sentience may not control
more than one character at a time, period.

No two characters may be logged in from the same IP or computer.  Period.
I do not care in the least that your school network masks all computers
with the same IP, or that you're supposedly on a home network.

Being logged on at the password prompt, or the pause for the MOTD,
counts as being logged on.  Linkdead characters are also considered to
be logged on.  Hence, dropping link on one character and logging another
character on is multiplaying.

If you believe somebody is multiplaying, post a note to admin on the
personal board, with their names and the system time (displayed with the
time command).

`RMultiplaying will be punished by the denial of involved characters, and
additional punishment as seen fit by the admin.  This is considered one
of the most serious offenses.`n
~

0 MOBILE SUIT~
Well, it appears you are a new trainee.  This helpfile will take
you through the basics of beginning your career as a mobile 
suit pilot. 

The first thing you must do is read these helpfiles:
PILOT, STATUS, SUITCOMMAND, SUITSHOPS, SUITTRAIN, EXPLOSION,
SUITEQ, SUITSTATS.

First you must go purchase a Leo.  I would always carry
3+ containers of Vernier with you as spare fuel, along with
5-10 repair kits for when your suit is damaged.  Also carry
spare ammo with you. Watch where constantly because
there are assholes who will break your suit.  If you have
zmud (or any alias program) make a set of fly aliases that
works for you.  Also remember to keep your suit full of
Vernier fuel, nothing is worse than running out in a fight
and not being able to flee.  There isn't much else that can
be said.  Just read those helpfiles, and work hard at being
a Gundam pilot, and you should do fine.
~

0 SUITEQ~
The available mobile suits can equip the accessories
listed here.

Leo: Buckler, 105mm Machine Gun, Beam Rifle, Dobergun, Beam Sabre.
Aries: Beam Rifle, Vulcans, Missiles, Beam Sabre.
Taurus: Beam Rifle, Beam Cannon, Laser Cannon, Beam Sabre.
Virgo: Shields, Beam Rifle, Beam Cannon, Laser Cannon.
Mercurius: Shields, Beam Rifle, Buckler, Crasher
Vayeate: Beam Rifle, Heavy Beam Cannon
Tallgeese: Buckler, Beam Rifle, Dobergun, Beam Sabre
Wing Zero: Heater, Miniguns, Beam Sabre, Twin Buster Rifle
Wing Gundam: Heater, Vulcans, Beam Sabre, Buster Rifle
Deathscythe: Buckler, Vulcans, Cloaker, Beam Scythe
Heavyarms: Buckler, Vulcans, Missiles, Beam Sabre,
           Gatling Gun, Miniguns
Sandrock: Heater, Vulcans, Missiles, Heat Shotels
Shenlong: Buckler, Vulcans, Dragon Fang, Beam Glaive, Flamethrower
Epyon: Buckler, Heat Rod, Beam Sword
~

0 SUITTRAINING~
Weapon/Combat - The trick is to find low sanced mobs.  
Sanctuary basically doubles the mobs hp allowing you to
get more attacks in. Olympus, Mahntor, Adepts (although
there is an evil pilot named Euthanasia who has claimed 
the adepts as his own)

Reflex - This skill will increase on its own, however if 
you need a large jump in it, just go find a large stack of
small mobs (draconia, hobgoblins, etc) and just stand there
getting hit while it raises quickly.

Aim - The best way to raise aim is with a vulcan cannon
it shoots alot of bullets quickly which allows for many chances
to increase.  A machine gun will do for the first 100 points,
past that use an Aries with a Vulcan cannon.

0 CHAOSIUM STATIC CHAOS 'STATIC CHAOS'~
Credits for Static Chaos a.k.a. Chaosium:

The Dikumud team: Thanks for releasing an easily customizeable codebase. 

Hatchet, Furey, Kahn: All the improvements to DikuMUD.

KaVir: None of your code is here, but at least at the start Chaosium
  was heavily influenced by the GodWars muds you've released.
  edit: No longer entirely true, I've imported a list of socials.

Erwin S. Andreasen: Thanks for the snippets, looking at auction I
  really should have wrote it myself.  Wouldn't want to do boards though.

Puck: TG was as good a true GodWars mud as I ever expect to see.  Thanks
  for the assist on that alloc_mem bug, too!

Camber & Alustrial: Even if you over-regulated and wussified WoD, it was
  a fuckin' awesome mud in it's time.

The ApocalypsE crew: We own, 'nuff said.

Larsen: .. whose commitment of time and effort to Chaosium is only
  exceeded by my own.  

Alathon: I credit myself?  Damned right I do!  You should too.

All the players of SC who helped to make it kick some serious ass, from the
early days of beta in '99 through the waning days of SC in '03.

0 MAZOKU~
Indigenous to the astral plane, Mazoku are astral beings who
live off of the negative emotions of mortals.  Fear, anger, hatred,
despair.. all of these feed the Mazoku hunger.  Malicious and evil
in their own right, Mazoku revel in their feeding.  When they take
shape on the material plane, Mazoku may appear mortal, or monstrous,
depending on their purposes.  With a natural command of the astral
plane, Mazoku can easily effect what lesser beings would term "magic".

 (*) Morph: Change between the Mazoku's true, human, and battle forms.
 (*) Develop: The means by which Mazoku learn how to interact
              with the material plane.
 (*) Grow: Grow an additional limb or body part.
 (*) Form: Form arms into various weapons.
 (*) Charge: Charge up astral energies for attacks.
 (*) Release: Release astral attacks.
 (*) Reform: Spend essense to repair physical form.
 (*) Astrike: Deadly attack from the astral plane.
 (*) Lash, Rake, Gouge: innate abilities of weapon forms.
 (*) Instantiate: Mold essense into a physical item.
 (*) Imbue: Spend essense to increase the strength of an astral item.

See helps for EGO, NIHILISM, ESSENSE, MATTER, and ASTRAL.
~

0 LASH RAKE GOUGE~
Syntax: lash
Syntax: rake
Syntax: gouge

With claws formed, a mazoku can rake their claws across an enemy
for quick and easy damage.

With tentacles formed, a mazoku can attempt to trip up an enemy
with lash, knocking them out of stance.

With spikes formed, a mazoku can jab their spikes into an enemy's
eyes, attempting to blind them.
~

0 MORPH~
Syntax: morph <form>
Example: morph battle

Mazoku are astral beings, and can exist in several forms on the
material plane.  Battle forms are hideous but effective in combat,
human form is useful for disguise, and in true form a Mazoku naturally
regenerates any damage taken.
~

0 DEVELOP~
Syntax: develop <ability>
Example: develop astrike

Develop is the means by which Mazoku acquire new abilities or
increase their skills in handling material and astral energies.
~

0 GROW~
Syntax: grow <body part>
Example: grow fourth

Mazoku can grow extra body parts for additional attacks, flight,
and enhanced material vision.
~

0 FORM~
Syntax: form <weapon>
Example: form blades

Mazoku can form their arms into weapons, each of which has
advantages and disadvantages.
~

0 CHARGE~
Syntax: charge <color of energy>
Example: charge obsidian

By charging up astral energies, Mazoku can prepare powerful
attacks with properties which vary by color.
~

0 RELEASE~
Syntax: release <attack type> <target>
Example: release bolt clout

When Mazoku have astral energies charged up, they can release
the energies as an attack in the form of blasts, bolts, or
bomb-like explosions all around them.
~

0 ASTRIKE~
Syntax: astrike

While in true form, mazoku can strike from the astral plane,
often appering right behind their target when they re-enter
the material plane.
~

0 REFORM~
Syntax: reform

Mazoku may repair any physical manifestation they inhabit with
their own essense.
~

0 INSTANTIATE~
Syntax: instantiate <equipment>
Example: instantiate cloak

By molding their essense into physical objects, Mazoku can create
items which are essentially part of them.  This is important, as
Mazoku disdain the use of almost all material items as unnecessary.

Astral items are linked to the Mazoku who created them; if such an
item becomes seperated from the Mazoku, it will fade from existance.
~

0 IMBUE~
Syntax: imbue <astral item>
Example: imbue ring

Imbuing is a means by which Mazoku may increase the strengt and
power of their astral equipment by pouring their own essense into it.
~

0 EGO~

Mazoku exist primarily through their own will to live, hence their
Ego is of utmost importance.  The more sure of onesself a Mazoku
is, the more powerful they are.  Killing things of at least moderate
challenge is fulfilling, while using powerful attacks against lesser
beings is a sign of weakness.
~

0 NIHILISM~

Within every Mazoku is a deep-seated need to destroy all of existance,
including itself.  As a Mazoku's need to destroy increases, it can
dominate their thoughts and actions.  Nihilisic Mazoku will likely
strike with greater abandon and do little to defend themselves.
~

0 ESSENSE~

Mazoku are beings of the astral plane, composed of astral energy.
Essense is another name for this energy, which Mazoku harvest
from mortals by causing them pain and death.
~

0 MATTER~

their material form, and actions on the material plane.
~

0 ASTRAL~

their astral form, as well as astral energies and attacks.
~

0 TELEPORT~
Syntax: teleport <target in area>
Example: teleport yurimaru

Mazoku can traverse short physical distances with incredible speed
by temporarily ducking back into the astral, and moving toward a
recorgnized target in the astral plane.  This costs essense, but
is highly useful.

0 RETIREMENT~

As Chaosium ages, people come and go.  Character even come and go,
as their players find themselves preferring different or new classes.
As a means of preserving some of Chaosium's history, and a reward for
serious pkillers, I'm making available the option of retiring characters.

Retiring a character removes them from play, for an indefinate period
of time.. perhaps retired chars may be allowed to come out of retirement
years from now, but not until then.  When a player retires, their record
will be added to a Chaosium hall of fame helpfile.  Their character will
also be immortalized in a hall of fame area, depending on their record,
reputation, play time, presense.. etc.. this can range from a statue and
plaque to a mobprogged mobile.

Requirements for retirement:
500 pkills.
Created six months or more ago.
500 hours played.
Full maxed status (SSJ, Shaolin, Runelord, Warlock/Archmagus/Ryozoku, Demonic)
500 primal

Btw, the 500 primal is to cut down on my workload.  Since, after all,
I need to do the ABing to carry this out.
~

0 SPEND TOKEN~
Syntax: spend <option>
Example: spend Weapons2

Tokens are granted by the admin as a reward for winning events
and turning in bugs.  They are shown on the score command, and
are non-transferable.

Spend is used to exchange tokens for various rewards.  These
include increasing some stances or weaponskills to 200, gaining
experience, and other such niceties.

Type spend with no argument to see an up to date list of rewards.
