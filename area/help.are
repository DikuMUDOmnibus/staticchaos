.



                             Welcome to Chaosium

                  We are now officially in beta.  While there
                  will be many changes, character concepts
                  will stay as they are, and any loss will be
                  reimbursed.

                  Yes, I agree, this login screen is lame.
                  Feel free to contribute ansi art if you're
                  so inclined.


                  Based on Diku Mud, created by Hans Henrik

-1 MOTD~
* We do not frown upon player killing and stealing.  If you do not 
  wish to player kill and steal there are other muds for you.. wuss.

* Type 'HELP' for (very little) help.  Also check 'HELP UPDATE'.

* Read '`CHELP RULES`n', '`GHELP POLICY`n', and '`RHELP MULTIPLAY`n'.
  Ignorance disgusts me and will be held against you.

* Skim the 'GWNEWBIE' help file, even if you aren't. Lots of
  relevant information to be found there.

* Character theft is now a `rdeniable`n offense.  That is, both the
  stolen character and the thief will be denied.  As always, I strongly
  advise players to `rNEVER`n, `rEVER`n share either characters or passwords.

* `RSorcerers are open for pking, might as well.`n

Press RETURN to eat shit and die: ~

0 CLASSES~
Classes on this mud (and indeed most godwars muds) define both the
race and profession of a character.  A saiyan is by definition of
saiyan birth, and is a saiyan warrior.  The vast majority of a given
character's abilities come from their class, not from the default
skills which everybody gets.  See the help files on 'SAIYAN',
'PATRYN', 'SORCERER', and 'FIST' for a more in-depth look at their
capabilities.~

-1 STORY~
One hundred and fifty years ago ...

Nomads from the Great Eastern desert brought spices and slaves to the Thalos
Market.  Dwarven miners, rough and rude, sold precious stones and drank the
town dry of firebreathers.  Stone golems, created by mages from the Tower of
High Sorcery, stood sentry duty in the watch towers.

It was dawn on the Day of Thunder.  The Mayor of Midgaard (great-grand-father
of today's Mayor) arrived early to pay tribute at City Hall.  He entered the
Grand Gate unchallenged.  He found the streets and markets empty.  Seeing a
nearby lamia, he asked her about the residents.  Where were all the people?

The lamia didn't act like a lamia.  Instead of answering him in the helpful but
stupid lamia manner, she stabbed the Mayor with a long, slim dagger.  Other
lamias, hearing the tumult, arrived and attacked.  The Mayor was killed.

Now Thalos is abandoned.  Wild lamias roam the streets, killing intruders and
sacrificing their bodies at the Temple of Thalos.  The golems no longer respond
to command and now watch eternally from their ruined towers.

Midgaard is next.


..............or not.

0 DAMAGE~
When one character attacks another, the severity of the damage is shown in the
verb used in the damage message.  Here are all the damage verbs listed from
least damage to most damage:

damage  =    0   miss
       <=    5   `bbarely`n
       <=   20   `bslightly`n
       <=   35   `bmoderately`n

                 `WMAC TRUCK HARD`n!!
~



0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with you (God wants you
to have your gold).

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is half-way back to
the beginning of your level.  Thus if you have a bad day and die several times,
the penalties won't clobber you.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
Only the player who died, or someone in the same group, can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse.

~



0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need 1000
experience points for each level of experience.

You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.
~



0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may buy one more pet each time you
advance in level.  Your pet-buying opportunities do not accumulate; use them or
lost them.  This policy prevents wholesale abuse of pets.

You are responsible for the actions of your pets.  Conversely, if you attack
someone else's pet, you will be penalized as if you attacked them.  It is
a good idea to refrain from attacking creatures labelled '(Charmed)'.
~



0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

You can tell when an area is about to reset by the patter of little feet.
~



0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~


0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.
~

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your inventory.
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~

0 BACKSTAB BS DISARM KILL MURDER~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: kill     <character>
Syntax: murder   <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used by thieves.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.

MURDER is used to kill other player characters.  There are restrictions on
murdering low level players, and there are penalties for using MURDER.

DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, or KICK successfully, you must practice
the appropriate skill.
~

0 FLEE RESCUE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

0 EXAMINE LOOK~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.
~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.
~

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.
~

0 EMOTE , POSE SOCIAL~
Syntax: emote <action>
Syntax: pose

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are
several dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK.

POSE is a variant of EMOTE.
~

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax: hold   <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear   <object>
Syntax: wear   all
Syntax: wield  <object>

Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start using
it as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves.  WEAR is for
armor.  WIELD is for weapons.

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.
~

0 CHANNELS~
Syntax: channels
Syntax: channels +<channel>
Syntax: channels -<channel>

With no options, CHANNELS shows you your current channels.  With a plus or
minus sign and an option, CHANNELS turns that channel on or off.
~

0 CONFIG~
Syntax: config
Syntax: config +<option>
Syntax: config -<option>

This command configures some of your character behavior.  With no options,
CONFIG shows you your current settings.  With a plus or minus sign and

kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere, although there is an experience
penalty for quitting outside of Midgaard.  When you re-enter the game you will
be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.

the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

ban list is cleared.

game and provide equipment and experience for a few levels.

Experienced players are encouraged to go through Mud School for their
initial levels and equipment.

You may not 'SAVE' your character until your character reaches 2nd level.

You may train your attributes and make them better at the Adept of Furey
one 'NORTH' and one 'WEST' of the Entrance of Mud School.  See 'HELP TRAIN'.

There is also a practice adept one 'NORTH' and one 'EAST' of the Entrance of
Mud School.  You may not practice until your character reaches 3rd level
however.  See 'HELP PRACTICE'.

-1 MOBINFO~
.             Our Mobiles have been infused with the breath of a

             Perhaps you have noticed this already.  If not, do
             take a moment to ask a mobile to tea.  The code is
             written by J Murphy, N'Atas-Ha of ThePrincedom and
             based on a concept created on Worlds of Carnage by
             Aaron Buhr.
	     Questions/comments to natasha@gs118.sp.cs.cmu.edu.
	     A little rewriting of the code/DOC/INSTALL done by
	     Kahn of MERC Industries and tested extensively on
             4th Realm (marble.bu.edu 4000).

0 NOTE 'NOTE WRITE' 'NOTE READ' BOARD 'NOTE SYSTEM' BOARDS~
Syntax:

board [number|name]                     Shows or changes board.
note                                    Reads next note.
note read [number]                      Reads a certain note.
note remove <number>                    Removes a note written by you.
note list [number]                      Shows up to number notes.
note write                              Posts a note.
note catchup                            Marks all notes in this board read.

These commands are used for the new note system. Instead of just one board, 
there are several, each with its special purpose. 

Changing between the boards is accomplished using the BOARD command. BOARD
without any arguments gives you a list of all boards together with number of
unread message. To change, type BOARD <number> or BOARD <name of the board>.

To read next unread note, type NOTE. To read a note with a specified number,
type NOTE READ <number>. Typing NOTE while in a board with no unread notes
shifts you to the next board. Note that unlike the standard note system, a 
note has the same number in NOTE LIST and NOTE READ.

Posting a message is as simple as writing NOTE WRITE. You will be moved 
into interactive mode, where all you see are prompts for the fields like 
To:, From: etc. You will be automatically put AFK while writing a note.

To see the list of the notes in the current board, type NOTE LIST. Typing
NOTE LIST <number> will list only <number> of the last notes in the area.

To see notes from a specific player on the current board, use the syntax
NOTE LIST FROM <player>.  For example, note list from xantos.

You can remove your own note by using NOTE REMOVE <number>. Implementors may
remove other people's notes. Implementors can also select how many days
their note is kept before being purged. Purging happens automatically at
bootup. Purged notes are not deleted, but saved into a file.

To let only immortals see your note, address it to "imm". To let players of
a specific level and above, address it to that level (no other recipients may
appear in that case).

This board system was created by Erwin S. Andreasen, erwin@pip.dknet.dk, aka
Phunk/Drylock and is freely available. The general outlook was based on
Mystic Adventure's note system (mud.gel.ulaval.ca 4000).
