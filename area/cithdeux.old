jiras guardian~
Jiras~
A red fox beastman glares at you through his one working eye
~
Cloaked and cowled, little can be seen of Jiras save his snarling foxes
muzzle.  Hanging from his cloak are dozens of fist-sized bombs, and both
his hands hold pistols.

grabos guardian~
Grabos~
A huge green lizardman orders Jiras to attack you!
~
Like Jiras, Grabos has lost an eye.  Scorning the more traditional eyepatch,
Grabos replaced his lost eye with a round-cut ruby, making his appearance
both garish and decidely fearsome.  He stands more than seven feet tall,
and his fists and tail will serve as ample defense should you enter
into a fight with him.

lesser daemon~
a Lesser Daemon~
A Lesser Daemon stands at attention.
~
Daemonic in nature, even the Lesser of the species is powerful
in its own right.  Six-inch serrated claws and tough, matted
fur make this Daemon a powerhouse in melee battle.  As well,
flames can be seen within its great maw, ready to be spewed
forth at will.

brau daemon~
a Brau Daemon~
A Brau Daemon stalks about, lusting for blood
~
A mixture of astral and physical life, the Brau Daemon is a
being to be feared by all but the most powerful.  It's
astral heritage grants resistance to nonmagical weapons as
well as bestowing energy attacks upon the Daemon.  Corded
muscle and taut sinew demonstrate the Brau Daemon's fearsom
fighting capabilities.

broken beaten~
Clout~
Broken and beaten, Clout now hands out quests to the Cith Deux.
~
Once upon a time, Clout thought to betray the founders of the
Cith Deux and ally himself with the Valheru.  Sadly for him,
he was consistantly destroyed by the members of Cith Deux and
eventually cast from the ranks of the Valheru.  Now, he has
nothing left to him but serving his new masters.

elrobos guardian~
Elrobos~
Elrobos morphs his hands into jagged 6-foot scimitars and lunges at you!
~
Blue-grey hair surrounds a wrathful visage of a face.  Nothing but violence
is to be found in Elrobos' eyes, eyes serving as windows for a mind bent
and warped by ages of war against servants of Darkstar.  Elrobos now
exists with only one purpose in mind: to save his people's planet.  All else
can be damned.

serius guardian~
Serius~
Serius is encased in energy, but stays his hand for a moment..
~
One word defines serius: pink.  Pink hair, pink clothes, even pink-hued
skin.  Regardless, Serius is by far more powerful than Elrobos.  His strength
lies more in the manipulation of energy than in physical combat, and
at this Serius excells.

dan peaceman~
`RDan`n~
`RDan`n wanders around, attempting to lead the Peaceman
~
Dan, the leader of the Peaceman Warriors for Justice, is unfortunately
quite clueless.  He is also quite old, and while he may have been a powerful
Warrior for Justice once upon a time, his greatest enemy now is
arthritis.  Still, he gamely attempts to wrong rights and depress the oppressed..

shittiest~
Jaraxle~
Jaraxle, the shittiest clan leader.. ever.
~
Once upon a time, a bold leader set forth with staunch compatriots
to form a new clan, one based upon the principles of Honor, Decency,
and Virtue.... `dNOT`n!!  Actually, he took the dregs of other clans,
all the worst, most clueless people in Cith Deux, and formed a sorry
ass clan that lasted about a week.  Cre.. Jaraxle's only success as
a clan leader was that he recognized how utterly pathetic both he
and his clan were, and had the clan disbanded a week after founding.

A cave entrance~
A large cave opening is before you.  While not especially forboding in
appearance, one must consider seriously what is to be found inside before
venturing within.  Sheer cliffs rise up from the cave mouth, far too high
to consider scaling.  At their top, an outcropping can be seen
pointing like an accusing finger to the north.

Inside the cave~
Darkness surrounds you like a damp cloak, and even the brightest light
fails to pierce the oppresive gloom.  The beginnings of stalgmites
and stalactites can be seen on the roof and floor, testifying to the
relative youth of this cave room.

Continuing into the cave~
Far older than previous rooms, huge stalagmites and stalactites reach
toward each other like bent teeth, creating the illusion of being within
the maw of a great beast.  Light can be seen glimmering to the north.

The transmission chamber~
Here, the cave walls have been worked into some semblance of smoothness.
At the far end of the room, a throne is carved from the rock wall, far
too big for anything of human dimension.  An odd clock-shaped device is
in one corner ticking away.  The center of the room is dominated by a
tremendous pentegram wrought of flourescent blue crystal.  One can only
wonder what use it could be put to.

The healing chamber~
The area is dimly lit by the glow of the huge crystal healing chamber
standing at one end of the room.  While this chamber has little use
for the denizens of this world, astral creatures can derive great benefit
from the healing properties of this crystal.

`dChamber`n of the `WCrystal`d Dragon`n~
You are standing in a vast chamber of night.  All around you,
darkness reigns.  If not for the millions of sparkles of light all
around you, you'd not see a thing.  Upon closer look, you can see
the entire chamber is carved out of black marbled stone, and just below the
surface, you can see hundreds of thousands of perfect crystals.  You take
a step back when suddenly, the entire chamber is filled with light.  You are
awed by the sight of this place.  Along the walls, there are several alcoves.
In each, there is another crystalline statue of a fiersome dragon.
Tapestries line the walls between the alcoves showing the awesome power
of dragons in battle.  In search of the light, you look down to the far end
of the chamber.  There you find an incredible throne of flawless crystal.
The legs of the throne, are the legs of dragons.  Intricately carbed into the
back and seat are dragon scales.  Over the top of the throne, a giant dragon's
head reachs out to rest over the head of whomever sits in the throne.
On either side of the throne, stand two pedestals, also made of crystal,
standing half the height of the room.  Atop each pedestal, there is
a burning ball of blazing white flame.  And above the throne, on the back wall,
is a gian wall to wall tapestry, depicting the fall of the Valheru to these
Dragons of Crystal.

a Secret Room~
You shift behind a stone and a wall opens up.  As you walk
in the world seems to disappear as a new knowledge of celtic
beings show you their appreciation.  You look straight up
and see nothing but eternal darkness.  You can't help
but wonder, how did they make this room?
