=== The function 'send_to_char'

The central output functions are 'send_to_char' and 'act'.  Of the two,
'send_to_char' is much simpler, faster, and less powerful.

The interface for send_to_char is:

    void send_to_char( const char *txt, CHAR_DATA *ch )

The string 'txt' is sent to the character 'ch'.  That's all there is to it.



=== The function 'act'

The function 'act' is much hairier.  The following section is a precise
reference guide.  If you don't already have some notion of what 'act' format
strings look like, then you should read some code which uses 'act' (such as
some of the spell functions in magic.c) to get a concrete introduction to this
function.

    void act( const char *str, CHAR_DATA *ch, OBJ_DATA *obj, const void *vo,
	int type )

    const char *str;

	This is a format string, with formatting specifications introduced
	by '$' (just as 'printf' introduces its formatting sequences with '%').
	Typically this is a complete sentence with a subject and an object.

    CHAR_DATA *ch;

	This is the subject of the sentence.

    OBJ_DATA *obj;

	This is the object of the sentence.

    const void *vo;

	This is the target of the sentence, as well as possibly the object of
	the sentence.  This may be either a victim, an object, or possibly a
	text string.

    int type;

	This is the 'to' type of the sentence.  Values are:

	    TO_CHAR	Send only to 'ch'.
	    TO_VICT	Send only to 'vo' (and then only if vo != ch).
	    TO_ROOM	Send to all chars in room except 'ch'.
	    TO_NOTVICT	Send to all chars in room except 'ch' and 'vict'.

	In every case, only characters in the same room as 'ch' are considered.

    Global boolean MOBTRIGGER;

	This is the global variable used to allow the mobprograms to trigger.
	It is default TRUE.

Each awake character in the same room as 'ch' is considered for output.  (Thus
'ch' must always be a legitimate character whose location is not NOWHERE).  If
the target character meets the 'type' requirements, then the formatting string
'str' is used to construct an output string, with '$' sequences substituted
using values from 'ch', 'obj', and 'vo'.

In the substitution of '$' sequences, attention is paid to visibility by
calling 'can_see' and 'can_see_obj' as needed.

The first character of the output string is always capitalized.




=== The '$' sequences

Here are all the '$' sequences supported by 'act':

    $T
	Result is simply the 'vo' argument interpreted as a string.

    $n
	Result is the name of 'ch'.  If 'ch' is not visible to the target
	character, result is the string 'someone'.

    $N
	Result is the name of 'vo' (considered as a victim).  If 'vo' is not
	visible to the target character, result is the string 'someone'.

    $e
	Result is 'he', 'she', or 'it', depending on the sex of 'ch'.

    $E
	Result is 'he', 'she', or 'it', depending on the sex of 'vo'
	(considered as a victim).

    $m
	Result is 'him', 'her', or 'it', depending on the sex of 'ch'.

    $M
	Result is 'him', 'her', or 'it', depending on the sex of 'vo'
	(considered as a victim).

    $s
	Result is 'his', 'her', or 'its', depending on the sex of 'ch'.

    $S
	Result is 'his', 'her', or 'its', depending on the sex of 'vo'
	(considered as a victim).

    $p
	Result is the short description of 'obj'.  If 'obj' is invisible to the
	target character, result is the string 'something'.

    $P
	Result is the short description of 'vo', considered as an object.  If
	'vo' is invisible to the target character, result is the string
	'something'.

    $d
	Result is the first word in 'vo', considered as a string.  If 'vo' is
	NULL, result is the string 'door'.  This is meant for extracting the
	name from a door's keyword list, but may be used in general for other
	keyword lists.
