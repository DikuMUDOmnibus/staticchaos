Monk Combos

Every basic attack will add to a monk's chi, when they feel that their chi is sufficient they can unleash a devastating combination attack This is accomplished by performing basic moves which add to their chi counter.  If they execute a combo, the mud will execute the move that matches their chi counter.  Some of these moves are devastating combos, while some are little more than a basic attack, only experience will help you learn which are which.
